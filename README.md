# ios-reversing
These files are to accompany this blog I wrote about how to do iOS reversing. This app is called breakmedaddy and it just has 1 functionality of a pw field. The purpose is to perform an input field bypass and patch ^_^ meeeowww 

If you're following my write-up, don't cheat! Just download the "payload.ipa" file as this is the application build for breakmedaddy app. If you unpack this, you'll find the actual breakmedaddy MACH-O file. 

I included the src just in case you wanted to compare src to what you're seeing in asm.
