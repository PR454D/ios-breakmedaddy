These files are to accompany a blog I wrote about how to do iOS reversing against this breakmedaddy app.

This content was never supposed to be a blog post as i was gonna just make it a simple tiktok video. but now tiktok is my MORTAL enemy, so now it's become a blog. oopsie.

If you're following my write-up, don't cheat! Just download the "payload.ipa" file as this is the application build for breakmedaddy app. If you unpack this, you'll find the actual breakmedaddy MACH-O file. 

I included the src just in case you wanted to compare src to what you're seeing in asm.
